Bit Manipulation
1. To check last bit of an integer do & operation with 1
2. if all bits of two sequences are different then |(or) operation can add both and give resultant

Arrays
1. Left/Right Scan
2. Find min/max
3. swap
4. Use extra memory for better time complexity
5. Utilize hashing

Linked List
1. Reverse the list - check size if odd or even
2. swap elements

String
1. we can do arithmetic operations such as + - on chars


TreeMap
1. TreeMap in Java acts as BST (red black tree) 
2. map.floorKey(key) returns the greatest key less than or equal to the given key, or null if there is no such key.

Priority Queue
1. Act as Heap 
2. Insertion, Deletion, search given element - O(logN)
3. Look up max or min element - O(1)

Left-Right Approach
1. Distribute Candies
2. Max distance in Arrays
3. Rain water trap
4. Arrays -> Max distance 
5. Arrays -> Maximum Unsorted Subarray (IB)
6. Arrays -> Product of Array Except Self(LC)


Window
Hashing -> Window String (IB - ADOBECODEBANC)
